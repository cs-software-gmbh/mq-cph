This directory contains a script which can be used to setup a queue manager for use with requester/responder tests.

Note that if you are using these scripts to setup a queue manager, for use with the MQ-CPH blog article 
"MQ-CPH Performance Harness Released on GitHub" at 
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/messaging/entry/MQ_C_Performance_Harness_Released_on_GitHub?lang=en
then you should use the cph command lines below, instead of the ones in the blog article. The queue manager setup has been changed to require a userid/password on the client connected requesters.

Issue the following command to start 200 responders across 10 pairs of request/reply queues (on the same machine as the queue manager)
cph -nt 200 -vo 3 -wi 0 -rl 0 -id ResP1 -tx -pp -tc Responder -ss 5 -to -1 -oq REPLY -iq REQUEST -cr  -dn 10 -jb PERF0 -jt mqb

Issue the following command to start 100 requesters across 10 pairs of request/reply queues:

cph -vo 3 -nt 100 -ss 5 -ms 2048 -wt 10 -wi 0 -rl 0 -id ReqP1 -tx -pp -co -tc Requester -to 30 -iq REQUEST -oq REPLY -dn 10 -jh mqhost1 -jp 1420 -jc SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN -jb PERF0 -jt mqc -us <mq userid> -pw <mq userid password>
