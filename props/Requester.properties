Requester.desc = Send messages to a Queue & gets a response from a different queue

# Options for Requester additional to those specified in MQOpts.properties

co.dflt = true
co.desc = Attach a correlId to the message and use it to get the same message back.
co.type = bool
co.xtra = This allows multiple Requesters to work with the same output queue concurrently.\n\
The correlation ID of the reply is expected to be the same as the automatically-generated \n\
message ID of the request. This option is true by default for historical compatibility.

# Message selector options
cs.dflt = false
cs.desc = Use message selectors to get messages off the queue
cs.type = bool

gs.dflt = UNSPECIFIED
gs.desc = Use generic selector instead of correlId to get messages off REPLY queue
gs.type = char[MQ_SELECTOR_LENGTH]

# No defaults for iq and oq set here, as they're currently also defined in DestinationFactory.properties

#iq.dflt = REQUEST
iq.desc = Input (request) queue name prefix.
iq.type = char[MQ_Q_NAME_LENGTH]
iq.xtra = If no other destination parameters are set, then nothing will be appended to this.

#oq.dflt = REPLY
oq.desc = Output (reply) queue name prefix.
iq.type = char[MQ_Q_NAME_LENGTH]
oq.xtra = If no other destination parameters are set, then nothing will be appended to this.

dq.dflt = 1
dq.desc = Number of DQ channels to use.
dq.type = int
dq.xtra = If this is set to more than 1, then additional channels will be configured on the client and server QM.\n\
Additional queue aliases will also be setup on the client QM, which in conjunction with setting the ReplyToQ to a Q alias \n\
will result in seperate reply channels being used for the reply messages.
